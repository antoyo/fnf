= How to debug a segfault?
:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: monokai

== Compile with debug symbols

Compile with `-g`:

[source,bash]
----
gcc main.c -o main -g // <1>
----
<1> Don't forget `-g` to have debug symbols.

== Valgrind

 * Memcheck (memory management checker)
 * Cachegrind (cache profiler)
 * Callgrind (cachegrind + callgraphs)
 * Massif (heap profiler)
 * Helgrind (thread debugger to find data races)
 * DRD (check multithreaded programs)
 * â€¦

== Clang sanitizers

 * Address sanitizer (`-fsanitize=address`)
 * Memory sanitizer (`-fsanitize=memory`)
 * Undefined behavior sanitizer (`-fsanitize=undefined`)

 * Leak sanitizer (`-fsanitize=leak`)
 * Thread sanitizer (`-fsanitize=thread`)

Source: http://clang.llvm.org/docs/

=== Good to know

As the doc says:

[quote]
____
Typical slowdown introduced by MemorySanitizer is 3x.
____

So do not run program in production with these flags.

Don't run a program compiled with clang sanitizers in valgrind.

== Fun Fact

Rust is mentioned four times in the Wikipedia page about Segmentation fault.

== Summary

[source,bash]
----
valgrind ./program

# OR

gcc main.c -o program -g -fsanitize=address
./program

# For Rust:

export RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address"
cargo run
