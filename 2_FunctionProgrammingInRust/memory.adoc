== Memory management

 * Automatic memory management (without garbage collector)
 * Memory allocated on the stack by default
 * `Box` to allocate memory on the heap
// NOTE: No need to call free.
 * References (`&` and `&mut`)
 * Ownership
 * Move semantics
 * Lifetime to determine where to deallocate memory
// NOTE: You'll get many compile-time errors when you start using Rust, but if you used Haskell, you'll be fine with that (except that you won't have your beloved monads).
